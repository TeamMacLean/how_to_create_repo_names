# How to create repo names

For every task we do, we keep code and results in private github repos. This serves as a shared lab book and record of what we did that we can keep across the team and out of email inboxes/individual laptops.

Each repo needs a name such that it can be identified.

Here is how to create that name. It is an underscore '_' separated list of

1) Initials of who the job is for (this can be yourself)
2) The groups internal tag, one of: NT, JJ, SK, WM, MM, 2B, PRO, BINF, SU
3) The ticket this job pertains to (always make a ticket)
4) DDMMYYYY date the job was started 
5) free descriptive text, no spaces! 

e.g 


`initials_group_ticket_date_desc`

`DM_BINF_1994_06122021_moryzae-dge`
